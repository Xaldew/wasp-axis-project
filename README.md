# Multi Camera Calibration

This is a project to attempt to perform camera calibration of multiple cameras
without using a calibration pattern. Instead of such a pattern, multiple cameras
are assumed to be surveying the same area, this redundancy is then used to
perform feature matching and subsequent bundle adjustment.
